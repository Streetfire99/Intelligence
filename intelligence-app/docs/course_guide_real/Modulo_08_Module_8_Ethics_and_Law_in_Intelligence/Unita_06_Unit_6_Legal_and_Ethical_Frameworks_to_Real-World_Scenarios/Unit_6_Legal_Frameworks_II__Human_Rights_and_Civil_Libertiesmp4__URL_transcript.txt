Welcome to Lesson 6 of Ethics and Law in Intelligence. This lesson focuses on one of the most critical, and often contested, areas of intelligence. The Protection of Human Rights and Civil Liberties will explore what legal systems say about rights like privacy, expression, and freedom of movement, and how those rights are challenged when intelligence agencies monitor people in the name of national security. We'll discuss how the law protects certain groups, such as journalists and minorities, and how those protections are tested by modern surveillance methods. You'll also hear examples of real-world rights violations, and explore how international courts and treaties can support accountability, even when national systems fail. Defining civil liberties, civil liberties are the basic legal rights and freedoms that protect individuals from abuse, especially from the state. These include the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression in the press, the right to freedom of movement and peaceful assembly, the right to due process, such as fair trial and protection from arbitrary arrest. These rights are grounded in national constitutions and reinforced by international law, including the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UDHR. Intelligence agencies often operate in the gray zone, where their need to act quickly and covertly intersects with these legal rights. This raises complex legal and ethical questions. For example, can a government intercept your messages without a warrant if it believes you're a threat? Can it place people under surveillance for political beliefs, religious identity or activism? These are not hypothetical questions, they happen in countries around the world. The challenge is to design intelligence systems that protect the public without eroding the foundation of a free society, surveillance and vulnerable populations. Political liberties are most often threatened when certain groups are singled out for surveillance. These groups frequently include journalists who investigate powerful actors, activists who organize protests and challenge norms, dissidents who criticize their governments, minorities who may, cameras outside mosques, metadata collected from worshippers, social media activity flagged based on keywords or region. This kind of profiling often leads to discriminatory practices, where people are monitored not because of behavior, but because of identity. That is not just unethical, it's often illegal, and it violates both the spirit and the letter of human rights law. Real world case, Pegasus Beware, one of the most striking examples of rights violations through surveillance is the case of Pegasus Beware. Pegasus was developed by the Israeli company NSO Group and marketed to governments for counter-terrorism and law enforcement purposes. But in 2021, investigations revealed it had been used to surveil journalists in Mexico, India and Morocco, human rights lawyers in France, politicians in Hungary and Rwanda, journalists in dozens of other countries. The Beware could extract texts, emails, audio and even activate microphones without the user knowing. Why is this so serious? Because the people targeted weren't criminals or terrorists, they were reporters, opposition figures or legal professionals exercising their rights. This case shows how surveillance technologies can be weaponized, not to protect public safety, but to undermine democratic accountability. Pegasus triggered legal and diplomatic fallout across several countries and prompted calls for stronger international regulation of surveillance tech, emergency powers and civil liberties. Another way civil liberties are threatened is through the use of emergency laws. During times of crisis, terror attacks, pandemics, large-scale protests, governments may declare emergencies that allow them to expand surveillance, suspend due process, restrict movement or expression, detain individuals without trial. While these powers may be justified temporarily, history shows that emergencies tend to last. Let's look at two examples. Post 9-11 United States, the Patriot Act gave intelligence agencies vast new powers to collect information. Terrorism provisions allowed bulk metadata collection, monitoring of library records and secret court orders. While originally intended for terrorism, these tools were later used more broadly and challenged by civil liberties groups. France, after 2015 terror attacks, a state of emergency was declared, allowing warrant to searches and house arrests. Although meant to be temporary, several powers became permanent under revised counter-terrorism law. In both cases, the balance between safety and liberty shifted and not always in favor of rights. International law permits limited temporary restrictions during emergencies, but only if they are necessary and proportionate, non-discriminatory, time-bound and reviewable. Permanent emergency becomes permanent surveillance and a permanent threat to rights, international protections and accountability. Fortunately, there are global legal bodies that set standards and offer remedies when civil liberties are violated. Here are a few examples. A European Court of Human Rights, ECFA, this court interprets the ECHR. It has ruled against governments that engaged in bulk data retention. Without safeguards, secret surveillance without oversight, disproportionate monitoring of peaceful activists. In one case, Big Brother Watch v. UK, the court found that UK intelligence programs lacked adequate protections and violated the right to privacy. The UN Human Rights System, UN Special Rapporteurs, regularly assess surveillance practices. In recent reports, they've warned against expanding biometric surveillance, targeting of political dissent, use of AI for population monitoring. Their reports help civil society challenge abusive laws and build legal reform campaigns. See regional and bilateral treaties. Many countries have signed binding treaties that establish data rights, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, Convention 108+, the Council of Europe's Data Protection Convention, national constitutional courts that defend rights against overreach. While enforcement varies, these frameworks set expectations and give individuals and groups tools to push back best practices for rights respecting intelligence. So how should intelligence agencies protect civil liberties? Here are several key legal and ethical best practices. Target with precision mass surveillance is rarely necessary. Agencies should focus on real threats based on evidence, not identity. Limit collection and retention, collect only what's needed, delete what isn't. Storage without purpose increases risk. Legal oversight and redress people must have a way to challenge decisions. Oversight bodies must be independent and well resourced. Avoid targeting protected groups, journalists, activists, and minorities should not be swept into surveillance nets. Special care must be taken to protect their rights. Publish transparency reports even if redacted. Regular disclosures build public trust and allow for scrutiny. To protect the international human rights framework, domestic law should align with the ECHR, ICCPR, and related treaties. No agency is above the law. Ethical intelligence doesn't mean weakness. It means strength with accountability and it builds trust between institutions and the public they serve. Let's recap the main points of this lesson. International liberties are foundational rights, including privacy, expression, movement, and fair treatment. Intelligence agencies must respect these rights, even in high-risk scenarios. Certain groups, journalists, activists, minorities, deserve heightened protection from surveillance. Spearware and emergency powers often erode liberties in the name of safety, but must be limited, lawful, and time-bound. International courts and treaties help set standards and offer accountability, even when national systems fall short. Best practices include targeted collection, independent oversight, and transparency. As a future intelligence professional or a citizen engaging with these systems, your job is to recognize the stakes, ask tough questions, and protect what matters mostâ€”dignity, freedom, and justice. In our next lesson, we'll explore how AI and technology are reshaping intelligence and what new ethical challenges they bring. Before moving on, review your quiz and slides, and reflect on this. Which rights would you defend most fiercely, and what would you do if your work put those rights at risk? Thank you, and see you in Lesson 7.
