**Unit 5: Global Nature of Intelligence Law and Ethics**

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the importance of law in intelligence activities
* Identify national legal frameworks governing intelligence agencies
* Recognize international treaties shaping intelligence behavior
* Distinguish between intelligence and law enforcement activities
* Analyze oversight and accountability systems for intelligence agencies

**Guided Learning:**

### Section 1: Introduction to Intelligence Law

* **Why Law Matters:** Intelligence agencies often have access to powerful tools, but these tools can also violate rights if misused. Law provides boundaries and legitimacy, telling agencies what they are allowed to do.
* **The Importance of Oversight:** Without legal oversight, intelligence can drift into authoritarianism. Even in democracies, unchecked intelligence has led to scandals.

### Section 2: National Legal Frameworks

* **Surveillance Laws:** Every country establishes its own rules for controlling intelligence activities. Common elements include laws defining when and how intelligence agencies can intercept communications or access data.
* **Examples of National Laws:** (e.g., USA PATRIOT Act, UK Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act)

### Section 3: International Treaties

* **International Agreements:** Intelligence agencies are governed by international treaties that shape their behavior. Examples include the Geneva Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
* **The Role of International Law:** International law provides a framework for countries to cooperate and ensure compliance with human rights and national security norms.

### Section 4: Distinguishing Intelligence from Law Enforcement

* **Key Differences:** Intelligence activities focus on gathering information, while law enforcement focuses on enforcing laws. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective oversight.
* **Examples of Intelligence Activities:** (e.g., signals intelligence, human intelligence)

### Section 5: Oversight and Accountability Systems

* **Types of Oversight:** Intelligence agencies are subject to various forms of oversight, including legislative, judicial, and executive branch review.
* **Accountability Mechanisms:** Mechanisms such as inspector generals, audit committees, and parliamentary inquiries ensure accountability for intelligence activities.
