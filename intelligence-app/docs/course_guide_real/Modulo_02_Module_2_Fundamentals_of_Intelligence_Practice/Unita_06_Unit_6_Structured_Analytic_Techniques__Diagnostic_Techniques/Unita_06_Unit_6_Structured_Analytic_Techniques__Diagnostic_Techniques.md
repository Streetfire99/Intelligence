**Unit 6: Structured Analytic Techniques - Diagnostic Techniques**
==================================================================

### Learning Objectives:

* Understand the purpose of diagnostic techniques in the intelligence cycle and their role in structuring analysis
* Learn how to apply Root Cause Analysis (RCA), including the 5 Whys and fishbone diagram
* Use SWOT Analysis to connect internal capabilities with external threats and opportunities
* Conduct a Key Assumptions Check (KAC) to identify and assess assumptions for impact and confidence
* Perform a Quality-of-Information Check (QIC) to evaluate source reliability and evidence credibility
* Integrate diagnostic techniques into a sequential workflow for stronger, evidence-based insights

### Why Diagnostics?

Diagnostic techniques are essential in the intelligence cycle as they help analysts understand the problem at hand before forecasting possible futures or brainstorming creative alternatives. Without a solid grasp of the current situation, even the most imaginative or well-modeled projections can rest on shaky foundations.

### Diagnostic Techniques:

The diagnostic family of techniques includes Root Cause Analysis (RCA), SWOT Analysis, Key Assumptions Check (KAC), and Quality-of-Information Check (QIC). Each technique brings a different perspective, but they all serve one purpose: to validate the strength of our analytical foundation before moving forward.

### Diagnostic Technique Applications:

#### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

* Identify the root cause of a problem using the 5 Whys method
* Create a fishbone diagram to visualize the causal relationships
* Apply RCA to understand the underlying reasons for a situation

#### SWOT Analysis

* Analyze internal strengths and weaknesses in relation to external opportunities and threats
* Connect internal capabilities with external factors to inform strategic decisions

#### Key Assumptions Check (KAC)

* Identify and assess assumptions for impact and confidence
* Evaluate the validity of assumptions and their potential risks
* Refine or revise assumptions based on new information or insights

#### Quality-of-Information Check (QIC)

* Evaluate source reliability and evidence credibility
* Assess the quality and relevance of available data and information
* Identify gaps, biases, or inconsistencies in the data

### Best Practices:

1. **Slow down**: Take the time to validate inputs and think before acting.
2. **Verify assumptions**: Challenge assumptions and evaluate their validity.
3. **Evaluate evidence**: Assess the credibility and reliability of available data and information.

### Conclusion:

Diagnostic techniques are essential tools for analysts to ensure that they understand the problem at hand before moving forward. By applying these techniques, analysts can validate their analytical foundation, reduce the risk of mistakes, and support stronger decision-making.
