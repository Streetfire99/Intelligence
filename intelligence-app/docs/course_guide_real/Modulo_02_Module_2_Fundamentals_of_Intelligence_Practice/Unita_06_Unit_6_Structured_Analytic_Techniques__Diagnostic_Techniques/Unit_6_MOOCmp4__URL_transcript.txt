Benvenuti in Unit 6. In this session we explore a specific group of Structured Analytic Techniques, those known as Diagnostic Techniques. These methods are used to understand the roots of problems, to check assumptions and to verify the quality of the information we are working with. Before we forecast or make predictions, we need to make sure we understand what is really going on. So, the goal of this lesson is to help you to extrapolate that. We learn how to apply root cause analysis, how to use SWOT analysis to assess strengths and weaknesses and how to conduct key assumptions and quality of information checks. All these tools are designed to improve reasoning, reduce risk of mistakes and support stronger decision making. So, let's begin with the basic idea behind the Diagnostics. Before we imagine the future, we need to understand the present, clearly, carefully and critically. Diagnostic techniques give us a structured way to examine how solid our current knowledge is. In high-pressure corporate environments, it's easy to jump straight into action to prediction or prediction. But if our evidence is weak or if our assumptions are fluid, then any forecast will stand on unstable ground. Diagnostics help us slow down just enough to spot these risks early. This means fewer errors, fewer wasted resources and more focused on intelligence. Diagnosing the problem is the first step towards solving it. The diagnostic family of techniques doesn't create new ideas, it tests existing ones. It helps us understand whether our thinking makes sense, whether our evidence is reliable and whether our assumptions hold up under scrutiny. Among the most important tools in this group we find Root Cause Analysis, SWOT Analysis, Key Assumption Check and the Quality of Information Check. Each of them brings a different perspective, but they all serve one purpose. To validate the strength of our analytical foundation before we move forward. By using diagnostics early, we make sure that work is based on truth, not guesswork. Now let's talk about the first tool, the Root Cause Analysis or RCA. This method helps us go beyond surface level symptoms and find the true reason behind a problem. Instead of fixing what's visible, RCA encourages us to ask, why did this happen in the first place? This is especially useful in business settings, where teams are often tempted to apply quick fixes. But without addressing the root cause, the same issue may appear again and again. So RCA uses simple, repeatable questions like the five whys and visual tools like the fishbone diagram to guide our thinking. It's a way to move from confusion to clarity and from reactive decisions to long-term solutions. RCA works best when it follows a clear sequence of steps, so a structured way of thinking also here. First, we define the problem as precisely as possible. If the issue is unclear, the analysis will be weak from the beginning, so pay attention. Then we ask why repeatedly, at least five times, to dig the surface. This technique, known as the five whys, helps us move from the visible symptom to the invisible cause. Next, we organize the answer visually using the fishbone diagram. This allows us to group potential causes into categories like people, process, technology, or environment. Once we've mapped the structure, we evaluate each causal chain to see which ideas are backed by evidence and which are just assumptions. Finally, we identify the root cause that can actually be addressed. This is where we should focus our efforts, because solving the right problem is the only way to create a lasting impact. Let's apply what we've just learned to a real-world example. Imagine a factory facing constant delivery delays. At first glance, it might seem like a logistic issue, but by using root cause analysis, we go deeper. So we ask, why are shipments late? Because production is delayed. Why is production delayed? Because a key machine breaks down often. Why does it break down? Because maintenance is irregular. Why is maintenance irregular? Because there are no systems to monitor usage. This simple chain reveals that the true problem isn't logistic, but it's the lack of preventive maintenance. Now, instead of spending money on external shipping solutions, the company can invest in a small monitoring system and solve the issue at its root. That's the power of structured diagnostics. Let's turn to another diagnostic tool, the so-called SWOT analysis. This method gives us a structured way to connect internal factors with external realities. The SWOT grid has four sections, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Strengths and weaknesses look inward, so they help us assess what an organization does well and where it struggles. Opportunities and threats look outward, at trends, changes and risks in the market or in the environment. SWOT helps us see how current capabilities can support future actions. It also shows where vulnerabilities could block our goals. And by combining both internal and external views, SWOT creates a clear strategic picture, one that links today's position to tomorrow's possibilities. To make SWOT truly useful, however, we need to go beyond listing ideas. So we must gather real evidence for each item, not just opinions. So we should rank each factor by two criteria. Its impact on the organization and how much control we have over it. Once ranked, we look for patterns. We can match a key strength with a new opportunity. Are there threats that connect to weaknesses and need urgent action? Finally, we use the completed grid to define two or three concrete strategic options. This turns the analysis into decisions and the framework into action. Now let's imagine a team working on a market entry strategy. They begin by using SWOT to assess the internal digital strength and compare them with new regional risks. They don't just fill the grid, they use it to find real insight. At the end, they identify three key elements. A digital strength that gives them an advantage, a promising market opportunity they can target and a weakness, like limited local partners, that must be fixed. From this, they build a focus strategy, one that connects assets to goals and turns diagnosis into action. This is what a well-executed SWOT should deliver. Now let's move to the key assumptions checks, or KAC. This method focuses on a critical step in the analysis, making hidden assumptions visible. Every judgment we make is based on assumptions, beliefs we accept as true. The KAC lists these beliefs explicitly and then scores them. We're looking at two things. How confident are we that the assumption is valid? And how big would the impact be if the assumption turns out to be wrong? Assumptions that are low in confidence but high in impact are very dangerous. They require immediate attention and sometimes new data or a different scenario plan. KAC helps analysts to face this risk before it becomes a failure. Now, to support this process, we use a simple visual matrix with two axes. As we have seen in the previous slide, one axis shows our confidence in the assumptions from low to high, and the other one shows the impact on the analysis if that assumption fails. So we then plot each item in the matrix. Assumptions in the top left quadrant, low confidence, high impact, are the ones we need to act on now. Those in the low impact or high confidence areas can be noted or monitored. This way we focus our time and resources on the most critical blind spots. It's a starter way to reduce analysis risk. Next, we evaluate the quality of the data itself with the quality of information check. So, score each data point along two dimensions. The first is source reliability, so how much we trust the source. It's usually graded from A to E. The second one is information credibility, so how believable the content is on a scale from 1 to 5. We then cross-tabulate these scores, and high reliability and high credibility items become strong pillars for the analysis. Low scores are flagged, they may need to be verified, for example, or removed from the key conclusions. This method helps us on solid evidence and manage uncertainty instead of ignoring it. Each of these tools is powerful on its own, but together they form a strong sequence. A typical workflow begins with a QIC to assess the quality of available information, then comes to the KAC, the K assumption check, to identify hidden risks. Then we apply the root cause analysis, or the SWOT, to explore the problem deeply and define clear options. Often, these tools will reveal gaps, and we return briefly to collection to fill them. This loop evaluates test structure and refine, tightens the logic of our analysis and improves final judgments. In diagnostics, structure leads to clarity, and this is the case of this phase of analysis. So now let's look at a case study. A consumer electronics company was facing stockouts, so products not available when needed. At first, they didn't understand the cause. A K assumption check showed that they had overestimated visibility into their tier 2 suppliers. A SWOT revealed that they relied too much on a single logistics sub. Then RCA showed the deeper issue, an outdated demanded planning system that couldn't track real-time trends. So this wasn't a logistic issue, but it was a structural one. The diagnostics gave leadership a clear path forward, so pay attention to this structural way of thinking when you do your analysis. As a result of findings, the company made focused improvements. They started dual-sourcing K components, they upgraded their planning tools, and built dashboards for real-time monitoring. They also negotiated contracts to allow for better data sharing, and these changes reduced back-orders by 25% in just a few months. But more importantly, they built reliability into their brand, turning resilience into a strategic advantage. Now I leave you a team exercise. To practice these techniques, participants now could apply them in live settings. Each team chooses a real challenge and applies three tools. The quality of information check, the K assumption check, and either RCA or SWOT. They finish by presenting one root cause, one critical assumption, and two action points. This hands-on approach helps internalize the methods and make the learning stick. To wrap up and conclude, diagnostic techniques help analysts strengthen the foundation of intelligence. By using tools like root cause analysis, SWOT, and assumption checks early in the process, we detect weak logic, bad data, or hidden beliefs before they become big problems. This saves time, protects credibility, and supports smarter, more confident decisions.
