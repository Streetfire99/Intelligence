**Introduction to Corporate Intelligence**
==============================

### What is Corporate Intelligence?

Corporate intelligence (also known as business intelligence or competitive intelligence) refers to the practice of gathering and analyzing information to help companies make better decisions and gain a competitive edge. Unlike government intelligence, which focuses on national security or military issues, corporate intelligence is about the business environment – competitors, markets, risks, opportunities, and operational challenges.

### Key Differences: Corporate vs. Institutional Intelligence

* **Objectives**: Corporate intelligence serves a company's goals (profitability, market share, risk management) rather than a nation's security interests.
* **Stakeholders**: The "customers" are corporate decision-makers – executives, product managers, security officers – instead of presidents or generals.
* **Methods**: Corporate intel relies heavily on open sources (public reports, market research, social media, industry gossip) and ethical information-gathering. There is no legal authority to access classified info – corporations must stay within commercial and legal bounds.
* **Ethics & Legal**: Companies must follow laws like those protecting trade secrets and privacy regulations. Good corporate intelligence sticks to ethical practices.
