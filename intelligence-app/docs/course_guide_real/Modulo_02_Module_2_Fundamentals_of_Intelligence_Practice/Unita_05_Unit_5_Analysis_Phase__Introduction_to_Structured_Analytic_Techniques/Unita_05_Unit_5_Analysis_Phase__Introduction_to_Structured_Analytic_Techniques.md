**Unit 5: Introduction to Structured Analytic Techniques**
=====================================================

### Learning Objectives

* Understand the role of analysis in the corporate intelligence cycle
* Recognize and mitigate common cognitive biases
* Apply Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) to improve clarity and rigor
* Assess evidence quality and challenge assumptions effectively
* Use tools like ACH and indicators for structured, forward-looking analysis
* Integrate SATs with visual tools and quantitative models
* Practice SAT workflows to detect risks and support strategic decisions

### Why Analysis?

Analysis is the engine that converts raw feeds (OSINT, CRM numbers, HUMINT from suppliers) into concise guidance for marketing, risk, and C-suite teams. Without it, leaders face an avalanche of data and a drought of insight.

### The Role of Analysis in Corporate Intelligence

The corporate intelligence cycle mirrors the classic four-phase model (Direction, Collection, Analysis, Dissemination), but with compressed timelines and outcomes tied to ROI. Analysis becomes the foundation for effective intelligence, keeping output synced with real business priorities.

### Cognitive Biases: The Invisible Saboteurs

Confirmation bias, anchoring, availability, sunk-cost... These shortcuts can lead to incorrect conclusions. Be aware of these mind traps and take steps to mitigate their impact on your analysis.

### Introduction to Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs)

SATs provide a structured approach to analysis, helping you to:

* Ask the right questions
* Identify key assumptions
* Assess evidence quality
* Challenge assumptions effectively

### Key Takeaways from this Unit

1. Analysis is critical in the corporate intelligence cycle.
2. Cognitive biases can undermine your analysis; be aware of them and take steps to mitigate their impact.
3. SATs provide a structured approach to analysis, helping you to clarify and rigorously assess information.
