### Activities and Reflections

1. **Geopolitical Case Study**: Analyze a real-world scenario where geopolitics played a significant role (e.g., Brexit, the Iran nuclear deal). Consider how different perspectives and choices influenced the outcome. Reflect on how your own analysis could have contributed to the situation.
