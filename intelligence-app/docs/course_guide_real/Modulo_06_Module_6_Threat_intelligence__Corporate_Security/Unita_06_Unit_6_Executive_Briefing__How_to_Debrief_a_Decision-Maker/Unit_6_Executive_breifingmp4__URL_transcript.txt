I'm Blaise and I have the pleasure to walk you through module 6 on how to debrief a decision maker and as you might have understood it's about executive briefing. So the objective here of that module is to structure briefings effectively ensuring that critical intelligence is communicated clearly and persuasively. The outcomes are is mostly on how to deliver concise actionable intelligence and security updates to leaders and decision makers. We will focus on structuring delivering and maximizing impact of security briefings at the executive level. So we can start by why executive security briefings matter. So decision makers rely on timely relevant intelligence to mitigate risk and seize opportunities. It's interesting to note that there is indeed two dimensions here so about mitigating risk and seizing opportunities. Effective briefings empower leaders to make informed strategic decisions under pressure and of course that notion of pressure it's about also timing that very often decision or reports and precisely these briefings are made under let's say a very short time frame because very often you have to respond to a particular crisis or an intelligence and very often the value of the intelligence mostly rely on its timing so how to react or mitigate a potential threat or attack etc. So security briefings support organizational resilience against evolving threats that's also a very good way to keep updated your staff your team or the executive about an existing threat which is constantly evolving. Then of course I give you here four example of what kind of security briefings you can see there are of course often but these are quite representative of what you could do in a let's say in your in an analyst position so daily and weekly threat updates that's quite interesting it's more like the follow-up on existing threat existing topics and precisely as we mentioned in the in the previous slide describing the evolution of a threat so that's as mentioned like a presidential kind of daily brief what you can as you can imagine. Then there is incident response briefings so it's mostly after a major security incident I mean an attack for example you're mostly debriefing about the incident and its outcome the reason etc. Then of course you have a special event or crisis briefing that it's also a very interesting exercise it's before major events for instance you are preparing for and evaluating the potential threat, building scenarios so really another kind of report and last but not least strategic risk assessment so it's mostly about your ability to assess a threat on a specific sector, company, region very ad hoc as we can say kind of briefing then moving on here are the core components of a security intelligence briefing it's a good way on how to structure it so title and purpose you really have to state clearly the subject and the objective of your briefing. Key judgments so it means your ability to summarize the main findings and that is really absolutely key and I do insist on that it's what we call the BLUF bottom line up front so it's really sometimes kind of counterintuitive to what you can see in your academic background or what you're being taught at university it's mostly to go with your conclusion and main findings from the very beginning so you start with what is the most relevant the most significant what you want to highlight and your recommendation and conclusion from the beginning from the most important to the least important and you don't wait the conclusion to do so. Threat assessment you have to highlight of course the relevant risk and intelligence analysis and implication so explain the significance and potential impact recommendation so you can of course provide actionable steps or decision needed last but not least you can also provide relevant data so of course sources evidence and other visual aids such as I don't know charts or maps they are always welcome and I've put you here exactly what I just explained so bottom line up front so it's a communication principle that emphasizes presenting the most important information or key message at the very beginning of a document again I really do insist on that because I know maybe some of you are not used to do so but that will happen very often when you have to brief an exec they have let's say within the minute understand the importance or the severity of the threat or about what you were reporting and again it's really key because sometimes they receive dozens of brief a day and they should be able to understand very quickly if they should pay attention to that one above that one so again it's a really a key principle to master and I really do insist on that I put you the link so you can read further and also try of course to build your your briefings using that particular structure then of course you can tailor your briefing to the decision maker so if you're within a company I'm sure you will understand a bit the personality or the need of each of the exec you will be you will be briefing so research the executive background priorities and preferred communication style seems obvious but really do it do your homework try to understand it's it's a more let's say in a on a psychological perspective how what is the best way to communicate with that person so adjust the format and detail to match their needs some prefer high-level summaries or they want more in-depth so yeah on that side that's really up to you but of course we come back to what I just said it's sometimes also that will make the value of the analyst within a company or within an organization your ability also to adapt yourself to the person you're you're debriefing or you're briefing in that particular case and you can use of course analogy or context relevant to their experience to clarify complex issues then best practices for security briefing delivery keep it concise so absolutely necessary focus on what happened why it matters and recommended actions again being concise and precise are two really essential concept for you for your briefing avoid too many contexts you don't have to to go too much into history and and let's say deep or deep reasons of why something is happening you really have to focus on on the the facts there are consequences and again why it matters so really keep it concise I know sometimes people tend to waste time on too much background too much context don't do that use clear jargon free language and visual for clarity that's also key because sometimes as an analyst you may master many concepts or jargon or or let's say it could be anything like political parties or companies or region etc maybe the exec don't know that so of course try to be as clear as possible and when also there is another effect if you don't understand something very well the effect is multiplied by two by the piece by your your listener so of course try to master well the concept and being able to explain them clearly and don't always assume that people will understand all the the jargon or or a subtlety of of the of what you are explaining again coming back to the bottom line up front prioritize the most urgent and relevant intelligence also key always tie threats and intelligence finding directly to the companies or organization interest again during your briefing you have to make logical ties between a particular incident and information or an intel and the companies or the organization interest why and again it comes out why it matters but try always to articulate these this reasoning again being clear and concise does not mean simplifying or oversimplifying and that's really a complex aspect of that of the the briefing it again i do insist sometimes people think that by being by simplifying there will be clear but no that's why it's difficult to properly brief you will have to very often depict or describe complex situation but yet remaining clear and concise and that what makes your future value certain as a good analyst and again be prepared to answer follow-up questions and provide additional detail if requested that's really important put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of the person you're briefing and what kind of question could they ask and be ready to answer them that's very frustrating if someone is i mean if i'm the exec and you're briefing me and i have some follow-up question and i can see you haven't prepared any because you thought i'll understand everything so really be ready to answer follow-up questions that's also part of the preparation and should be definitely you can have a separate sheet where you have written some more precision and of course that's also where you can fit more context or more background if someone asks you so verbal debriefing techniques of course we come back to what i've quite insisted already of course maintain professionalism and confidence use a calm and assertive tone it's more on your let's say body language and ability to express yourself calmly and clearly also engage the person you're talking to so if there's question or if they see they're not convinced or they see that they have interrogation or or again read body language and be able to make let's say to rebound on your ideas or clarify some of the concept you're you're you're mentioning and last but not least of course practice active listening to address concern and adapt your delivery and what is what i've just mentioned so practical exercise preparing a security briefing so as an exercise i do suggest you to select a recent security incident or intelligence report then of course you have to define the profile of the person that you'll be that you'll be briefing so what do you think that he or she is like is he a CEO of a let's say cyber security company that wants to expand their offices or or in india for instance try to build a persona try to build let's say an interesting profile and then you will have to of course adapt your security briefing to that particular person structure the briefing using the core components components outline and of course prepare concise slides or talking points anticipate detective questions and prepare clear evidence-based response so what we just saw in the previous slides delivering the briefing so present your briefing to peer or an instructor acting as the exec focus on clarity brevity and actionable recommendation then a big part of the interest of the exercise is to have some feedback and to be able to readjust or of course better your your your briefing of course that's that's what i'm what i meant by refine your approach based on feedback and future for future briefings well i guess that the key takeaways executive briefings must be concise relevant and actionable tailor your message to the audience to the audience's need and decision making style practice and feedback are essential for mastering effective intelligence communication and i'll let you apply these skills to real-world scenarios to support organizational security and inform leadership thank you very much for your attention
