Welcome to Unit 4 of Module 8 EU Governance and Intelligence, part of the Massive Open Online Course of the Analyst Project, a new advanced level for your specialized training. Welcome to the fourth unit, where we turn our focus to digital intelligence and cyber security within the EU context. In this unit, you will learn what cyber intelligence means, how it has evolved from traditional intelligence practices and why it's so vital today. We'll cover major legal frameworks like the NIS Directive and the GDPR, explore institutions like ENISA and dive into operational concepts like Cyber Threat Intelligence, also known as CTI. We'll also examine how intelligence plays a role in detecting and countering disinformation and hybrid threats. By the end of this unit, you'll have a solid understanding of the strategies, tools and challenges the EU faces in this ever-changing digital battlefield. Let's begin with the definition. Cyber intelligence is the process of gathering, analyzing and applying information about cyber threats and digital vulnerabilities. It helps protect critical infrastructure, digital services and public and private networks. It refers to the collection and analysis of data from digital environments to detect and respond to threats. It is used by governments, companies and EU agencies to anticipate attacks, understand threat actors and protect key assets. This intelligence goes beyond raw data. It includes understanding motivations, timing and impact, often with the support of machine learning or behavioral analytics. In the EU context, cyber intelligence is central to risk assessment and policy planning across sectors such as energy, transport, health and defense. If you want to learn more about cyber threats, visit this website of the EU Agency for Cyber Security. This type of intelligence focuses on identifying who is attacking, what their goals are, how they operate and how to defend against them. It involves technical data like malware signatures or IP addresses, but also behavioral analysis and geopolitical context. Cyber intelligence didn't emerge in a vacuum. It evolved from traditional intelligence practices. In the past, intelligence focused heavily on physical surveillance, human resources and secure communication. Much of the action has moved online. Intelligence must now monitor social media, detect phishing campaigns, trace malware and track geopolitical narratives through digital platforms. Traditional and cyber intelligence still overlap, but digital intelligence introduces new techniques, new tools and faster pace. This shift requires new skills, new agencies and a deeper integration between cybersecurity professionals and intelligence analysts. From the traditional human source-based intelligence, we went to digital intelligence using networks, devices and online platforms. Now analysts combine both types to understand how threats work, how complex they are. The next step is automation and AI that have increased the scale and speed of threat detection. The security strategy today relies on digital tools to monitor cybercrime and hybrid threats. Cyber intelligence is not just about reacting to attacks, it's about preventing them. As cyber threats become more and more sophisticated, the ability to detect early signals is very important. Digital intelligence helps by identifying vulnerabilities before they are exploited. A few steps that are included in this prevention process are flagging anomalies like repeated login failures or unexpected traffic. Another one is using threat intelligence feeds to spot known malware. Coordinating with EU agencies, such as in the first unit, we have seen a whole list of EU agencies but also of national agencies, to share risk alerts across borders and responding faster than attackers can move. For example, detecting a phishing email campaign aimed at critical infrastructure could trigger early alerts, enabling defenses to be raised in time. This kind of proactive intelligence is essential for resilience. It turns guesswork into preparedness and reduces the time between detection and response. That is why digital intelligence is now seen as a frontline of defense, not just a support function. Let's go on to the NIS directive. We'll see it now from a more detailed angle. We have already mentioned it in the previous units. It is really one of the key legal frameworks shaping cybersecurity in the EU. The NIS is short for Network and Information Systems Directive. This law requires member states to ensure a high level of cybersecurity across critical sectors like energy, transport, finance, and health. It obliges organizations to report major incidents, invest in risk management, and cooperate through national and EU-level structures. A newer version called NIS-II further expands the scope and introduces stricter enforcement. Together, these directives aim to build a stronger and more connected cybersecurity ecosystem, where threat preparedness is not optional but definitely mandatory. In short, the first directive, NIS, required operators to report incidents within 24 hours. It improves early warning systems between member states and promotes real-time risk analysis and information exchange. Additionally, in the updated directive, NIS-II, the coverage extends to public administrations, space, and food sectors. NIS-II sets minimum requirements for incident response capabilities. Then we go on to the GDPR in digital intelligence. We will look at the rights and the risks. Of course, cyber intelligence must always balance protection with privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation, or known as GDPR, is a cornerstone of this balance. What intelligence professionals need to balance is profiling. They are only allowed under strict conditions. This affects use of automated threat detection. Anonymization. Raw data always must be stripped of identifiers when used in training AI models. Purpose limitation. Intelligence can't be reused for unrelated investigations. While intelligence services need access to data to detect threats, they need to respect the rights of individuals. This includes limiting the scope of surveillance, ensuring transparency where possible, and applying data minimization principles. GDPR doesn't prevent intelligence work, but it sets guardrails. It ensures that digital security efforts don't come at a cost of fundamental rights. This is a constant balancing act that requires legal clarity, technical precision, and strong institutional oversight. In a practical example, a cybersecurity platform can flag suspicious behavior, but sharing personal info with law enforcement still needs a legal basis. To learn more about those legal frameworks, visit the EDPB website on this link. Now we'll focus on the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, the ENISA, which is the EU cybersecurity agency based in Athens. ENISA supports member states by providing expertise, developing standards, and coordinating cyber exercises. It plays a key role in implementing...

implementing the NIS directive, and shaping the EU cybersecurity certification schemes. Yes, so NISA supports both national governments and EU institutions in preparing for and responding to cyber threats. Its annual Threat Landscape Report is a key source for analysts across Europe. You can check out those landscape reports on their link that you can see below. So they publish these threat reports, but these help to build early warning systems, and they provide guidance on best practices for both public and private organizations. So in short, NISA is not an intelligence agency, but it's an essential partner for the agencies that do collect and act on cyber intelligence. So Cyber Threat Intelligence, or short CTI, is a specific branch of cyber intelligence focused on understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors. CTI includes technical data like malware hashes, IP addresses, domain names, but also contextual analysis, such as motivations, affiliations, and risk levels. So here we have different structures, different levels of the structure helping organizations to detect, understand, and respond to attacks. So first of all, we have the strategic CTI, those are trends and big picture threats for senior decision makers. Then we have operational CTI, that are the technical patterns and context around specific threats. In the tactical CTI, we have detailed indicators like malware hashes or phishing domains. In the CTI feeds, we have automated streams from trusted providers. And the purpose, it enables a preemptive action and more targeted defense. But let's see how CTI works in practice. So imagine a national energy grid receives reports of unusual login attempts from foreign IP addresses. CTI analysts gather threat indicators from other sectors and compare them with known threat actor profiles. They discover that the IP addresses match a hacking group linked to state-sponsored cyber operations, the intelligence shared with the other EU states via platforms like Siena or through any sub-networks. And thanks to this coordinated response, protective measures are deployed early and the threat is contained. This is the value of CTI, actionable insights that lead to fast collective response. So the entire cycle from collection to response can really just take hours when coordination works well. Here's a short case study, an example, a real-life example of the 2020 SolarWinds hack. That was a significant supply chain attack compromising the Orion software platform. It was one of the most important cyber incidents in recent years, really. This massive supply chain attack compromised thousands of organizations worldwide, including several EU institutions. The EU responded with an urgent review of digital supply chain risks, intelligence services and cybersecurity teams worked together to trace the breach, identify compromised systems and assess the long-term damage. The case also led to new investments in CTI capacity and a broader discussion about serenity and cybersecurity, who controls the tools we rely on. The SolarWinds case reminds us really that cyber intelligence is not theoretical. It's critical. It's a critical tool for defending Europe's institutions and infrastructure. Here if you're interested in the case of SolarWinds, in this incident, you can check out the ANISA Threat Landscape Report, where it is broadly mentioned. Hybrid threats blend different tactics to destabilize societies without open conflict. They combine conventional and unconventional tactics, often blending cyber attacks, disinformation, economic pressure and even physical sabotage. They are hard to attribute, hard to predict, and they're designed to exploit the grey zones in international law and public trust. Cyber intelligence helps detect the technical components of hybrid threats like malware, botnets or network disruptions, but it must be prepared with political, social and media analysis to fully understand how hybrid threats work. This makes hybrid threat detection one of the most multidisciplinary and demanding areas in modern intelligence. You can read more about how NATO defines and responds to hybrid threats in the following link on the bottom of this slide. Now we focus on tools to counter disinformation and hybrid threats. The EU uses several tools to counter disinformation, including fact-checking platforms, AI-driven monitoring systems and rapid alert networks for emerging threats. One of the best known is the EU versus Disinfo, which tracks and exposes state-backed narratives through public reporting. The European Digital Media Observatory, the EDMO in short, supports a network of national fact-checking hubs and research centres across member states. The rapid alert system, on the other hand, enables swift coordination between EU institutions and countries in response to disinformation threats. So you see there are a couple of tools that are counteracting disinformation. Other initiatives help detect coordinated campaigns involving bots and trolls. So these efforts are really designed to promote transparency while upholding legal protections for free expression. So the goal isn't just to delete lies, but to understand who's spreading them, why and how to counter them strategically. These EU institutions monitor foreign information manipulation, especially during elections or geopolitical crises. So cyber intelligence supports these efforts by tracing the sources of fake content, identifying bot activity and linking online behaviour to offline goals. Intelligence and disinformation may both deal with information, but their goals couldn't be more different really. Intelligence seeks to reveal truth, to provide accurate, timely and actionable insight for decision makers. On the other side, disinformation does the opposite. It manipulates facts, exploits emotions and aims to divide or distract. That's why the fight against disinformation isn't just a tech issue. It's an intelligence challenge. So analysts must detect falsehoods, trace their origins and assess their impact. This requires not just data, but critical thinking, cross-sector cooperation and strong ethical standards. Here we see how the EU fights hybrid threats. So the EU's response to hybrid threats involves multiple layers. Strategically, it builds resilience through legislations like the Digital Services Act and partnerships with platforms to moderate content. Operationally, it coordinates also with NATO member states and agencies like ANISA or INTC and to monitor risks and share intelligence. So hybrid threats are increasingly used to exploit the vulnerabilities of open societies without triggering traditional military responses. Understanding how to build resilience against these tactics is really essential for European security. If you want to learn more, here is a whole lecture on the evolution of hybrid threats and possibilities, how to counteract them, led by the Director of Hybrid, CEO Yi, highlighting how they evolve, the tools used to counter them, and why coordinated action between states and societies is key to defending democracy.
