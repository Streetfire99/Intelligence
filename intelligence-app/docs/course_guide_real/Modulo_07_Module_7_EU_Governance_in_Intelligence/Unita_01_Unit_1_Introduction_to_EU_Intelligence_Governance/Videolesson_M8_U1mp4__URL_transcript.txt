All right, welcome to Unit 1 of the EU Governance in Intelligence course. This is the eighth module of the analyst project, titled A New Advanced Level for Your Specialized Training. This unit is all about the foundations of how intelligence is governed across the European Union. Whether you're brand new to this topic or already familiar with security policy, this is where we build the core understanding. We'll explore what intelligence governance actually means, how it has evolved in the EU context, and why it is so vital to European security and democracy today. Okay, so Unit 1, in this unit we explore what intelligence governance means in practical and political terms. We look at how it developed historically within the EU and why it's essential for managing modern threats like cybercrime, disinformation, and geopolitical instability. So by the end of this unit, you will be able to define intelligence governance in the EU context. You will be able to explain the difference between national and EU level systems. You will trace the development of the European Union's intelligence structures, identify main institutions involved, and you will understand how intelligence supports EU security and defense strategy. We will do this in four sections, as you see on the right side in the table of contents. So there are four parts, defining intelligence governance, evolution of the EU intelligence structures, key EU intelligence institutions, we'll see a list of those, and intelligence in EU security policy. Right, so let's get into the first unit. First of all, we'll start with the concept and scope of intelligence governance. So what do we actually mean by intelligence governance? At its core, intelligence governance refers to how intelligence is managed, how it is shared and overseen. So this includes the rules, the frameworks, and institutions that shape the entire process from collection and analysis to distribution and use. So in the EU, this governance framework must balance effective security with democratic accountability. Intelligence must help protect citizens while respecting the law, civil liberties, and human rights, obviously. So it's not just about collecting data, it's really about making sure intelligence activities are legal and necessary and proportionate. In the EU model, intelligence is a public function that operates under the rule of law. So if you are willing to read further, if you want to explore the topic more, feel free to pause and to check out this paper that has been published by the European Parliament to learn more about the landscape of the EU's intelligence corporation. So why is intelligence governance so important in the EU, especially in the EU's decision-making? It plays really a vital role in helping EU institutions to make informed decisions. It supports evidence-based policymaking by delivering current and accurate information. It helps identify and assess security threats early. So this is very important. So they identify before they escalate into crisis. It shapes strategic thinking in foreign and defense policy and contributes to emergency preparedness. For instance, during cyber incidents or major geopolitical developments, intelligence helps the EU actors respond quickly and effectively. It also improves coordination between institutions, ensures efficient resource allocation, and supports key actions like sanctions, peacekeeping, and border management. So in short, intelligence makes EU action smarter, faster, and more cohesive. So in the EU, intelligence governance exists at two levels. One is the national level, and then we have the EU level. So nationally, each member state has its own agencies and structures, often based on specific legal, political, and security traditions. We'll come to that in a second in the next slides. So these agencies typically focus on domestic threats, foreign intelligence, or military issues. So there are different categories in those agencies, and the oversight varies widely. Some countries use parliamentary committees, others rely on judicial review or specialized independent bodies to ensure that intelligence work stays within legal and ethical bounds. So here's just a quick fun fact to illustrate this variety. So Sweden has actually two completely separate intelligence agencies. One is the MOST, M-U-S-T. This handles military intelligence, while SAPPO is responsible for the internal civilian security. So this kind of split structure reflects Sweden's broader approach to civilian-military separation, and it is not common across all EU countries. Many other member states combine these roles within one single agency, but we'll see this division in the next slides, because some of them do have this separation and this division. Others have only one agency. So this institutional diversity is important because it shapes how each country collaborates or sometimes struggles to collaborate within the EU-level intelligence frameworks. So let's see how some of the EU member states function in this regard. So here we have a table of agencies and what they focus on. So we see, for example, France has two agencies. One is the DGSI, the other one is DGSE. One is focused more on domestic security and the other one on foreign intelligence. So the first half of the table, as you see, covers France, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Spain. Germany, if we go further, Germany follows a similar model as France with the BFV and the BND, while Italy has only one for internal affairs and the AISE for foreign threats. So this is also divided. Spain's CNI operates with a broader scope, covering both internal and external intelligence. These agencies operate under different rules, mandates, and reporting structures, but they all contribute to national and regional security. So this variety makes coordination complex, but also rich with expertise and specializations that can be shared across borders. And then we go to... So here, each agency is linked to the names on the left side of the table. If you want to check out how these agencies work and how they are structured and built, you can click on the links of the agencies and check those out. Same in the second half of the table. So the second half includes Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland. These are only examples. Of course, each country in the EU has their own agencies. Those are only to show you how they work. So as we mentioned earlier, Sweden uses two distinct agencies, the SAPO for domestic security and MOST for military intelligence. The Netherlands splits responsibility between AIVD, which handles domestic and foreign intelligence, and the MIVD, which is the military branch. Belgium, on the other hand, has the VSSE for internal security and the SGRS for military intelligence. Then we have Poland. There we have the ABVU, which handles internal threats, and the AIVU covers external intelligence. So this overview highlights just how decentralized intelligence remains within the EU. Each country brings its own legal framework, institutional model, and political culture into the shared European security space. So that means that when we talk about the EU intelligence governance, we are really talking about stitching together a patchwork of national systems. Right, then we have the supranational intelligence governance in the EU in comparison to the national frameworks. So now we shift from national systems to the supranational level. Even though intelligence has traditionally been a national competence, the European Union has gradually built governance mechanisms that operate across borders. These don't replace national agencies, of course, but they help them coordinate, especially on shared threats like terrorism, cyber attacks, and organized crime. So the EU's approach is based on voluntary cooperation.

states decide what to share and when. But institutions like the INTCEN, Europol or Frontex act as central hubs, receiving intelligence, analyzing it, and then feeding it back to the member states in a usable form. So this one is one of the most delicate balancing acts in EU governance, creating a framework that's strong enough to function, but on the other side also flexible enough to respect national sovereignty. EU Intelligence Corporation didn't appear overnight, of course. It evolved slowly, but very reactively. So let's see how this evolved in the course of history of EU Intelligence Corporation. So back in the 1990s, EU member states were focused on building economic integration. Intelligence remained a national matter, and most cooperation happened informally, through bilateral police and security contacts. That changed after a series of global and European crises. The 9-11 attacks in the US, the 2004 Madrid bombings, and the 2015 Paris attacks all acted as major wake-up calls for the EU and the world globally as well. These events highlighted the limits really of siloed intelligence systems. So the EU responded by building more structured cooperation mechanisms, starting with INTCEN, then expanding through Europol, and later through various counterterrorism and cyber security frameworks. But even now, this process remains cautious and fragmented, because member states are still reluctant to fully integrate. Cooperation happens, but it's often slow and obviously very politically sensitive. This slide shows key milestones in the EU's efforts to build an integrated intelligence framework. So we start with the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, where security and defence first appeared as official EU topics. Then in 1999, the Amsterdam Treaty created the area of freedom, security and justice. After 9-11, the EU began developing more serious counterterrorism policies. In 2002, INTCEN was created to provide intelligence assessments at the EU level. Following the Madrid bombings in 2004, the EU appointed its first counterterrorism coordinator. By 2010, the Stockholm Programme emphasised information exchange as a key element of EU internal security. And in 2015, after the Paris attacks, the European Counterterrorism Centre was established within Europol. Most recently, the 2020 Security Union Strategy formalised the EU's commitment to tackling threats like cybercrime, terrorism and hybrid warfare through enhanced intelligence cooperation. So while intelligence remains nationally driven, the EU has clearly taken steps to support a more unified approach. Now let's focus on the role of INTCEN and its capabilities. So this institution is the EU intelligence and situation centre. It's the cornerstone of the EU's intelligence analysis capability. It doesn't collect intelligence itself. Instead, it receives input from member states, diplomatic services and many open sources. But its job is to really transform that information into strategic assessments that support EU foreign policy, cooperation and security. Crisis management and security planning. Importantly, the INTCEN works with civilian intelligence only, not military. So its role is to provide high-level cross-border analysis rather than operational action. It is part of the European External Action Service and it plays a key role in helping EU leaders understand global risks and regional instabilities. So in short, this institution is the EU's internal think tank for strategic security intelligence. All right. So the INTCEN doesn't work in isolation. It collaborates also with Europol, Frontex and national agencies to build a shared understanding of threats. Europol deals primarily with criminal intelligence, especially related to organised crime and terrorism. It coordinates investigations and helps member states share information in real time. Then we have Frontex, which focuses on border intelligence, especially migration flows and human trafficking. But national agencies are still the main players because they decide what intelligence to share and how much. So this creates a complicated network, one where success depends less on legal mandates and more on trusts, habits and the willingness to cooperate, really. One of the core challenges of the EU intelligence governance is sovereignty. So member states are often reluctant to share sensitive information with EU bodies. They worry about confidentiality, political misuse and losing control over their national priorities. This tension makes full integration really difficult. The cooperation exists, but it remains limited and cautious. Legal differences, bureaucratic procedures, mutual mistrust, this all still slows things down. And despite recent progress, most intelligence sharing in the EU is still very informal, ad hoc and very incomplete. To move forward, the EU will need to build more trust, strengthen legal frameworks and show that integration can really enhance and not undermine national interests. If you want to learn more and have a look at the perspective of Ursula von der Leyen, you can watch this short video. So just pause the presentation and go to the PowerPoint on the platform where you can play this video. Intelligence plays a foundational role in the EU's common security and defence policy, or CSDP. It helps identify threats, monitor geopolitical developments and inform strategic decisions in areas like peacekeeping, crisis response and conflict prevention. It also helps the EU detect and respond to hybrid threats like disinformation, cyberattacks and election interference. It supports both civilian and military missions inside and outside the EU territory. Moreover, intelligence strengthens partnerships with global actors like NATO, the United Nations and regional organisations. When we talk about the EU as a global security actor, we're really talking about an intelligence-driven approach to diplomacy and defence. On the other side, despite its growing role, the EU still faces major challenges in using intelligence for defence. First, sharing remains uneven. Some countries are more open than others and threat perceptions vary widely. Second, bodies like INTCEN are limited to strategic assessments. They don't conduct operational intelligence, which leaves a gap in real-time responsiveness. Third, there is an ongoing tension between secrecy and accountability. Intelligence work must be discreet, but EU citizens also expect transparency and oversight. And finally, coordination remains voluntary. Without a centralised authority, progress depends on political will and mutual trust. So these issues don't undermine the EU's efforts, but they do show how much work remains to be done. So just to sum up the first unit, which we are now coming to an end with, we've defined intelligence governance as the framework that oversees how intelligence is collected, shared and used, both nationally and at the EU level. We have seen that national intelligence systems are diverse, shaped by unique histories and legal traditions. We have traced how the EU intelligence structures evolve slowly, largely in response to crisis events. And finally, we have looked at how intelligence contributes to EU foreign and defence policy, while highlighting the challenges of integration, trust and sovereignty. So this foundation sets up for the next unit, where we will dive deeper into intelligence sharing mechanisms within the EU. Just to strengthen your knowledge from this unit, to try to reflect on what you have learned and follow this activity, take your time to fill in this reflection. Thank you very much.
