**Unit 2: Intelligence-Sharing Mechanisms in the EU**
=====================================================

### Learning Objectives

* Understand why intelligence-sharing is vital for EU security
* Distinguish between EU and intergovernmental models of sharing
* Identify key legal frameworks that regulate intelligence exchange
* Describe tools like SIENA for secure information sharing
* Analyze the main barriers to effective intelligence collaboration

### Unit Overview

This unit explores how EU countries share intelligence, the legal and technical systems behind cooperation, and the challenges they face. We will examine why intelligence-sharing is crucial for collective security, the legal foundations behind it, and the technical tools that support it.

### Part 1: The Need for Intelligence Cooperation

* **Why Intelligence Sharing Matters**: Explore the EU Security Union Strategy 2020 to better understand how intelligence-sharing fits into the broader European security framework.
	+ In today's interconnected world, security threats easily cross national borders. Terrorism networks, cyberattacks, organized crime, and hybrid warfare are challenges that no single country can address alone.
	+ Intelligence-sharing allows EU countries to pool information, detect threats earlier, and coordinate faster responses. Cooperation strengthens the resilience of the European Union.

### Part 2: Legal and Institutional Frameworks

* **Legal Basis for Intelligence-Sharing**: Understand the legal basis for intelligence-sharing under EU treaties.
* **Regulations Affecting Intelligence Exchange**: Learn about regulations that affect intelligence exchange, such as GDPR and NIS Directive.

### Part 3: Intelligence Exchange Mechanisms

* **Secure Communication Channels and Data-Sharing Platforms**: Describe tools like SIENA (Secure Information Exchange Network Application) for secure information sharing.
* **The Role of SIENA**: Explain the role of SIENA in facilitating secure communication channels and data-sharing platforms.

### Part 4: Challenges in Intelligence Collaboration

* **Barriers to Intelligence-Sharing**: Identify key barriers to effective intelligence collaboration, including:
	+ Trust
	+ Data protection
	+ Political interests
* **Case Study: Intelligence Cooperation in Counterterrorism Operations**: Analyze a case study on intelligence cooperation in counterterrorism operations.

### Assessments and Activities

* Complete the quiz at the end of each section to test your understanding.
* Engage with discussion forums to share your thoughts and learn from others.
* Participate in case studies and scenario-based exercises to apply what you have learned.

By the end of this unit, you will be able to explain why intelligence sharing is necessary for collective security, describe the legal and institutional frameworks that govern it, evaluate the main platforms for intelligence exchange, and identify key challenges that still need to be addressed.
