Welcome to Module 8 of the Analysts' Project, a new advanced level for your specialized training. In Unit 2 of the EU Governance in Intelligence module, we explore the mechanisms of intelligence sharing within the European Union. This unit is all about understanding how EU countries cooperate to exchange information that is vital for security. So we'll see how they share, under what rules, and using what platforms. We will look at the reasons intelligence sharing is so important, the legal foundations behind it, and the technical tools that support it, such as Ciena. You'll also learn about the barriers that still limit cooperation, things like trust, oversight, and political will. By the end of this unit, you'll be able to explain why intelligence sharing is necessary for collective security, describe the legal and institutional frameworks that govern it, evaluate the main platforms for intelligence exchange, and identify key challenges that still need to be addressed. We'll begin with the why, why this kind of sharing matters in the first place. In today's world, threats don't respect borders. A cyberattack launched in one country can affect businesses, hospitals, or public institutions across the EU within minutes. A terror plot may involve suspects or logistics spread across several countries. Organized crime networks operate in multiple jurisdictions at once. So that's why intelligence sharing is not just helpful, it's absolutely essential. No single member state can track or respond to these threats alone. Sharing intelligence allows the EU countries to identify risks earlier, coordinate faster, and respond more effectively. So it's all about creating a shared sense of situational awareness, so that no one is caught off guard, and every response is based on the best available information. Explore the EU Security Union Strategy that was established in 2020 to better understand how this intelligence sharing fits into the broader European security framework. So you can pause this presentation and go to the platform, to the PowerPoint, where you can click on the link. Intelligence sharing has both tactical and strategic benefits. First of all, it enables early detection of cross-border threats. When one country sees the first sign of a problem and shares that information, others can act before it's too late. Second, it speeds up response. So shared alerts and common databases allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to coordinate their actions. It helps also to avoid duplication of effort. So if one agency has already done the work, others don't need to repeat it. It increases efficiency in how resources are used, whether it's personnel, funding, or technology. And lastly, it helps also the EU act as a collective body, rather than 27 individual states. So that's key to building long-term resilience against cyber, terror, and hybrid threats. There are two main ways intelligence is shared in Europe. Through EU structures and through direct intergovernmental channels. The EU-driven intelligence sharing happens through institutions like Europol and INTCEN. These bodies help centralize information, apply common standards, and produce shared analysis. This model promotes cohesion and reduces that fragmentation that we have. Intergovernmental sharing, on the other hand, is very direct, country to country. It's usually faster and more flexible, but it also can be inconsistent. And it often depends on personal trust or political alignment. The EU doesn't force countries to share intelligence. Cooperation is absolutely voluntary. And that creates tension between collective goals and the national sovereignty that is so much needed and wanted by each country. In practice, both systems operate side by side, sometimes complementing each other, but sometimes creating overlap or gaps. Even though intelligence remains a national competence, the EU treaties do provide legal grounds for cooperation. One of the most important is Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, commonly called the Solidarity Clause. It says that EU countries must support each other in the face of terrorism or disasters, including by sharing information. Another is the Lisbon Treaty, which formalized cooperation in areas like law enforcement, border security, and justice. These legal instruments don't give the EU control over national intelligence, but they do encourage structured collaboration. They create an obligation to support one another in times of crisis and build a basis for joint response. In addition to the treaties, the EU has several regulations that affect how intelligence can be shared. First of all, the GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation. This sets strict rules for handling personal data. It includes how intelligence is processed and shared between states and agencies. Then we have the NIS Directive and its updated version, the NIS2, which focus on cybersecurity. They establish requirements for how critical sectors like energy, transport, or healthcare report incidents and exchange threat intelligence. These laws create a framework that supports sharing, but also protects individual rights and promotes trust in the system. In this slide, we bring all the key legal instruments together for a clearer overview. We have the Lisbon Treaty, which lays the political foundation for cooperation. We have the Solidarity Course, which is the Article 222, which legally requires member states to help each other. We have the GDPR, which regulates how data can be shared. The more important are the NIS.

and the NIS2 Directive, which set rules for cybersecurity and information exchange in essential sectors. Then we have the CER Directive, which focuses on infrastructure resilience. And finally, the EU Classified Information Framework, which sets standards for handling and protecting sensitive documents. So together, these create the legal backbone of intelligence sharing in the EU, defining what's allowed, what's required, and what needs to be protected. Let's move now from legal frameworks to practical tools. Secure intelligence sharing depends on reliable, encrypted communication systems. One of the most important is CENA. That's the abbreviation for the Secure Information Exchange Network application. It's operated by Europol and allows national agencies to share data securely and quickly. There's also the Europol Information System, or EIS, which stores criminal intelligence accessible by member states. The European Union has also strict protocols for handling classified documents called the EUCI or the EU Classified Information. These rules govern how documents are labeled, how they are stored and accessed, ensuring that sensitive material always stays secure. These tools make sharing possible. It's not just in theory, but in daily operations. So now let's take a closer look at CENA. To go back, there's a fun fact about CENA. This network processed more than 1.1 million intelligence messages between the EU member states in 2022 alone. That's about 3,000 messages per day. That shows the amount of work that they do to secure exchange. Now let's see how CENA works. CENA is a real-time communication tool used by law enforcement and security agencies across the EU. It allows users to exchange messages, case files, alerts and intelligence reports using encrypted channels. Each user is registered and verified and access is strictly controlled. Only the agencies involved in a specific case can see the data. Even Europol officers can only access information if they're directly assigned. This ensures absolute confidentiality, integrity and traceability. In 2022, CENA handled over 1.1 million messages, showing how central it is to the daily work of CENA and law enforcement coordination across Europe. Here's an example of how CENA works in practice. Imagine a suspicious traveler is flagged by authorities in one country. Using CENA, that information can be instantly shared with other countries along the person's route. This includes biometric data, known aliases, travel history and potential affiliations. If another country has relevant data, like a previous arrest or evidence from a separate investigation, they can add it to the case in real time. This kind of coordination can trigger surveillance, detainment or further investigation, preventing a potential threat from slipping through the cracks. Without a platform like CENA, this kind of cooperation would be slower, less secure and much harder to coordinate. Despite all the tools and treaties in place, intelligence sharing in the EU still faces serious barriers. One major issue is political mistrust. Some countries are reluctant to share sensitive data because they worry about how it will be used or whether it could leak. Another issue is fear of losing control. Intelligence is a sovereign function and not all governments are comfortable handing over information to EU institutions. Technical fragmentation is another problem. Different systems, standards and procedures can make sharing difficult or unreliable. These barriers reduce the efficiency of the system and in some cases they can delay or derail critical responses. One of the most difficult questions in intelligence governance is this. How do we ensure accountability? Intelligence must remain secret, but democracies also require transparency and oversight. At the national level, oversight bodies like parliaments or independent commissions review intelligence practices. But at the EU level, this kind of scrutiny is much weaker. There is no centralized watchdog and member states guard their sovereignty very closely. This creates a grey zone where information is shared across borders, but not always supervised in a coordinated way. Improving oversight mechanisms while still protecting sensitive operations is one of the major governance challenges facing the EU today. The 2015 Paris attacks were a pivotal moment for intelligence cooperation in the EU. In the aftermath, investigators found that several countries had pieces of the puzzle, but they hadn't been shared in time. Some suspects were known to intelligence services in one country, but their profiles hadn't been circulated to others. This tragedy highlighted the cost of poor coordination and led to major reforms. Since then, platforms like Ciena have become more widely used. But the case also shows that tools alone are not enough. Intelligence cooperation depends on speed, trust and political will to act together before it's too late. Here you have also an article that shows details about the 2015 Paris attacks. As an activity, you can summarize key lessons that the EU learned about intelligence sharing after the attacks, just to strengthen your knowledge that you have gained in this unit. Here's another activity that you can do. Pause the video and reflect on what you have learned. Thank you very much.
