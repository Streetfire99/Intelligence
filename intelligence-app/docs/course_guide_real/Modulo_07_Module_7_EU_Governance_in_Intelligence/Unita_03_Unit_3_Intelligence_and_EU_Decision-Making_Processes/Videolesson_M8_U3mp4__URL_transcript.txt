Hello and welcome to Unit 3 of Module 8 of the ANALYST project, a new advanced level for your specialized training. Module 8 focuses on EU governance in intelligence. This section, Unit 3 of the course, explores how intelligence contributes directly to policymaking at the European Union level. You will see how intelligence helps the EU understand global risks, formulate strategic responses, and navigate foreign policy decisions. We'll also look at how intelligence is processed through what's called the intelligence cycle and how it flows into key institutions and decisions. By the end of this unit, you will be able to describe how intelligence feeds into diplomacy and policy. You will understand the balance between internal and external uses of intelligence and how scenario planning and foresight are becoming central tools in EU decision making. Let's start by exploring the general role that intelligence plays in shaping EU policies. Intelligence helps EU institutions go beyond reaction and move toward anticipation. It offers timely insights that inform decisions in foreign policy, security, and even trade and energy policy. In times of crisis, intelligence helps EU leaders understand what's really happening. Cutting through noise, misinformation, and uncertainty. But it's not just for emergencies. Strategic intelligence supports long-term policy, planning by identifying risks, analyzing trends, and helping leaders make informed, forward-looking choices. It also plays a major role in detecting hybrid threats like election interface, disinformation campaigns, or cyber sabotage. These are subtle, complex risks, and intelligence makes them visible. Let's take now a closer look on how intelligence is actually processed. This happens through what's known as the intelligence cycle. It starts with direction, when policymakers or institutions identify a need for information. A collection might include open source data, diplomatics reporting, classified intercepts, or reports from intelligence partners. Next is processing and analysis, where raw data is turned into actionable insights. After that comes dissemination. Intelligence is shared with decision makers through reports, briefings, or digital dashboards. Finally, we have the feedback phase, the implementation, where the site is useful, or there are new questions emerging. This feeds into laws, missions, crisis plans, or strategic decisions. This cycle isn't linear. It repeats and evolves constantly. Understanding this process is key to understanding how intelligence supports the EU governance. In the EU, intelligence serves both internal and external purposes. Internally, intelligence supports law enforcement, border control, and crisis response. It helps track criminal networks, terrorist threats, and cyber attacks. Externally, it supports diplomacy and foreign policy. This includes monitoring foreign elections, analysing geopolitical risks, and assessing the stability of neighbouring regions. While the goals differ, the tools and data often overlap. And so does the challenge. How to use intelligence while respecting legal boundaries, ethical norms, and member-state sovereignty? The EU must balance these needs, working across internal and external dimensions, without overstepping its role. When it comes to diplomacy, intelligence is quite a quiet but powerful tool. It provides early warnings about crises, assesses political stability in partner countries, and helps shape negotiation strategies. It also helps track international sanctions compliance, detect covert operations, and anticipate global shifts from energy markets to regional conflicts. By drawing on intelligence from both member states and EU services like TCEN, the EU can craft foreign policy that's informed, coordinated, and timely. This is especially important in moments of crisis, when fast decisions are needed, and when bad decisions can have major consequences. Here you can check out the European External Action Service, how they work, and what impact they have on the EU diplomacy and foreign policy. So just click on the link on this laptop icon. EU institutions rely on intelligence briefings to support their work, especially in security, defence, and foreign affairs. For example, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs receives daily briefings that combine open-source analysis with classified inputs. Then we have, obviously, the three most important bodies that are key EU institutions. First of all, the European Council that receives strategic threat briefings to inform foreign policies and defence direction. Then we have the European Commission. The Commission uses intelligence and policy proposals, regulatory preparedness, and emergency coordination. And last but not least, the European Parliament. Committees of the European Parliament receive classified briefings to shape legislations in areas like cybersecurity and external relations. Furthermore, the INTCEN and other agencies produced strategic updates tracking troop movements, disinformation campaigns, and energy disruption risks. This shows how intelligence doesn't just react. Sorry, EU delegations around the world feed intelligence back to Brussels. And INTCEN then compiles, analyzes, and delivers tailored updates to Russia.

relevant bodies, such as the Council, the Commission and the Parliament on occasion. These briefings support decision-making at every level, from technical planning to top-level diplomacy. Now, let's look at a real-world example. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the EU imposed a wave of sanctions targeting individuals, companies and entire sectors. These decisions were not made blindly. Intelligence briefings helped identify key actors to target, assess the likely impacts and anticipate Russian countermeasures. The CINTCEN and other agencies produced strategic updates tracking troop movements, disinformation campaigns and energy-disrupting risks. This shows how intelligence doesn't just react to war, it shapes how the EU responds diplomatically, economically and strategically. Foreign policy is complex and high-stakes. Intelligence plays a key role by providing reliable information when official diplomatic resources may be biased, limited or unavailable. It helps the EU decide where to act, whom to support and how to respond to unfolding events. But using intelligence in foreign policy also raises questions. How much information should be shared publicly? How do we avoid misuse? And how do we ensure that intelligence doesn't lead to overreaction? For more information, please visit this podcast. This episode, The World in 30 Minutes, shows you how intelligence and strategy shape EU foreign policy. So this I can highly recommend. These are really ongoing dilemmas, but what's clear is that foreign policy without intelligence is like flying blind. The EU uses intelligence as part of structured risk assessment frameworks. This means intelligence feeds into formal models that score, rank and map threats, whether that's energy dependency, migration flows or political instability. This approach helps decision-makers prioritise where to invest, which partners to engage and how to prepare for worst-case scenarios. It also enables cross-sectoral analysis, for example, how cyberattacks on energy infrastructure might spill over into food systems or transport. These frameworks transform raw intelligence into actionable strategies. For more information, visit this link to the YouTube video and look at how the EAS, Crisis Response Centre, works around the clock to manage emergencies and support EU coordination during crises. Intelligence isn't just about understanding the present. It's also about anticipating the future. That's where strategic foresight and scenario planning come in. EU institutions use this approach to think through possible futures, whether it's a fragmented global order, a major technological breakthrough or climate-driven migration. Analysts develop scenarios based on data, trends and weak signals. These aren't predictions, they're mental models that help leaders stress-test their plans. This kind of thinking is critical for resilience. It ensures the EU is not just reacting to crises, but preparing for what's next. Here we have three tools. One is the horizon scanning, which tracks global instability signals or policy blind spots. We have the red teaming, which simulates hostile actions against the EU interests. And risk matrix, which prioritizes threats for budget and attention focus. The INTC and scenario workshops often include a wildcard event, like unexpected technological failures or extreme weather. So they really try to be prepared for anything. Just an example, as we already talked about the war in Ukraine, let's see what was the NATO response to the war in Ukraine. It has been a turning point for European intelligence cooperation, not just within the EU, but also with NATO. NATO and the EU have intensified their exchange of intelligence, aligning threat assessments, sharing satellite imagery and coordinating policy responses. This includes joint monitoring of hybrid threats, disinformation and military movements. The Ukraine war has shown that intelligence must be agile, real-time and shared across institutions, not siloed. And it's reaffirmed that effective collective defense depends on robust and trusted intelligence. To explore how NATO and the EU work together to respond to the Ukraine crisis, you can visit this link and to see an overview of their actions. To close this unit, let's reflect on what we have learned from recent crises, especially in Ukraine. First, speed matters. Intelligence must be delivered fast enough to shape decisions, not just confirm them. Second of all, trust and coordination are essential. Coordination weakens response, and on the other hand, integration strengthens it. Third of all, intelligence needs to support long-term strategy, not just short-term reaction. That means investing in foresight, risk analysis and institutional memory. Intelligence is not just about knowing, it's about acting. In moments of crisis, good intelligence saves lives and really shapes history. So the conclusion is that intelligence is not just a defense tool, it is essential for protecting values, maintaining trust, strengthening Europe's voice in the world. To train your knowledge and skills that you have gained in this unit, you can go through this activity, just pause the video, the presentation and reflect on what you have learned. Imagine you are in this scenario and try what you have learned in outlining a five-point response. Thank you very much.
