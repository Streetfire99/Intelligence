**Unit 6: Intelligence, Governance, and Crisis Management**

### Learning Objectives:

* Understand how intelligence supports crisis prevention and early warning systems
* Describe coordination mechanisms between EU institutions during crises
* Analyze intelligence responses to non-traditional threats (health, climate, economy)
* Learn from intelligence successes and failures in real-world crises
* Propose strategies for improving intelligence-based crisis governance

### Unit Overview:

Intelligence plays a vital role in identifying potential crises before they unfold, enabling better EU preparedness and faster response. This unit will explore how intelligence helps anticipate, respond to, and recover from emergencies.

### Learning Outcomes:

#### Part 1: Intelligence in Crisis Prevention and Early Warning Systems

* Understand the role of intelligence in forecasting crises before they escalate
* Learn about EU mechanisms for detecting security threats

#### Part 2: Coordination Between EU Institutions During Crises

* Understand the role of intelligence in emergency response coordination
* Study crisis management structures within the EU

#### Part 3: Intelligence Responses to Non-Traditional Threats
