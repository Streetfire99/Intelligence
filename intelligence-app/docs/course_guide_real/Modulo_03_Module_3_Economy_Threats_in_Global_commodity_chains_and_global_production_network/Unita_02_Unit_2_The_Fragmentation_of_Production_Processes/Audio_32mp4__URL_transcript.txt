The fragmentation of production processes. The fragmentation of production processes is a key phenomenon within the dynamics of global value chains, GVCs, and the global production network, especially in a globalized economic context. This process refers to the decomposition of productive activities into a series of stages that are distributed across different regions or countries, allowing companies to take advantage of comparative advantages and reduce costs. This phenomenon is deeply related to outsourcing and offshoring, which entails a rethinking of a traditional organization of work in national terms. In a global economic scenario, companies face the need to be more competitive and efficient, which has led them to seek solutions that maximize profitability. Fragmentation allows companies to divide their production process into specific phases and move them to places where operational costs can be reduced, such as cheap labor or the availability of natural resources at lower prices. For example, while product design or development activities can remain in developed countries, manufacturing or assembly can be outsourced to developing countries where labor costs are significantly lower. This dispersed production model optimizes resources and allows for economic specialization, though it also creates dependency among the countries involved in the process. However, the fragmentation of production processes also presents various economic threats that impact both the nations involved in the stability of global supply chains. One of the most obvious risks is vulnerability to economic crises or geopolitical disruptions. Since supply chains rely on the interdependence of several production stages located in different places, any disruption in one part, such as political conflicts, pandemics, or natural disasters, can interrupt the flow of materials and intermediate products, severely affecting global production and supply. Another challenge associated with fragmentation is the increased complexity of supply chain management. Companies must coordinate various logistical operations, ensuring that inputs arrive on time and in the right conditions, which can lead to higher operational costs and the need for more intensive supervision. Furthermore, the fragmentation of production processes can have negative consequences in terms of environmental sustainability. Long transport distances for intermediate goods create a larger carbon footprint and greater exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices and other resources. Fragmentation can also generate negative effects on local economies, especially in countries that are excessively dependent on the manufacturing of intermediate products or assembly. By not diversifying the productive base, these economies become vulnerable to changes in global demand or competition from other countries offering lower costs. Additionally, the lack of a more complete industry can limit technological development and innovation at the local level, as product design and development processes are often kept in advanced countries, leaving emerging economies in a role of assembly and basic production. In conclusion, the fragmentation of production processes has been one of the main characteristics of economic globalization. While it allows companies to optimize their costs and become more competitive, it also introduces significant risks to global supply chains and poses economic challenges for both developed and emerging countries. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial for countries to adopt strategies to diversify their productive sectors and, at the same time, foster international cooperation that seeks greater stability and resilience in global production networks.
