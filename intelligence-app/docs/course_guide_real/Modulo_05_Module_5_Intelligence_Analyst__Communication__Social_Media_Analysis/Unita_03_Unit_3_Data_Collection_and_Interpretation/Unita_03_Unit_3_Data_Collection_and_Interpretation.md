**Unita_03_Unit_3_Data_Collection_and_Interpretation**
======================================================

**Module Overview**
-------------------

This module introduces three topics: multivariate data analysis, time series analysis, and network analysis. We will explore these techniques to identify patterns and relationships between variables, analyze seasonal fluctuations, predict the future, understand temporal patterns, and investigate network properties.

**Learning Objectives**
--------------------

* Understand the concept of multivariate data analysis and its applications
* Learn about simple linear regression and how it can be used to analyze relationships between two variables
* Discover the importance of data quality and preprocessing in data analysis
* Explore time series analysis techniques, such as ARIMA models and exponential smoothing
* Investigate network analysis using graph theory and social network analysis

**Guided Learning Path**
-------------------------
