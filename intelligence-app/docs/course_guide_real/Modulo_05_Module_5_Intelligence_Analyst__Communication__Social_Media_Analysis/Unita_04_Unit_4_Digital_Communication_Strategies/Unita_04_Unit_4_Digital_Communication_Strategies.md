**Unit 4: Digital Communication Strategies**
=====================================================

### Learning Objectives:

* Understand the concept of unsupervised learning and its applications
* Learn about clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques
* Familiarize yourself with preprocessing methods for unsupervised learning
* Explore the concept of distances in unsupervised learning
* Introduce K-Means algorithm as a popular clustering technique

### Textual Content:

The provided PDF content introduces unsupervised learning as a type of machine learning that finds patterns in data without labeled examples. It highlights two common techniques: clustering and dimensionality reduction. The text also touches on preprocessing methods, such as standardization, normalization, feature engineering, and recoding variables.

#### Key Points:

* Unsupervised learning is used to find hidden relationships between observations
* Clustering groups similar data points together
* Dimensionality reduction simplifies data by focusing on the most important features
* Data may be preprocessed before unsupervised learning approaches
* Standardization and normalization can help reduce outliers
* Feature engineering can reduce data dimensionality using principal component analysis (PCA)
* Recoding variables can convert categorical variables into numerical ones or create new features

### Audio Content:

The provided transcript introduces the concept of unsupervised learning in the context of data analytics. It highlights the importance of considering different approaches to analyze data and find patterns.

#### Key Points:

* Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that helps find patterns in data without labeled examples
* The goal is to define the problem, understand what to do with the data, and then use the data to get explicit answers
* Approaches can be univariate, multivariate, or descriptive/exploratory
* Computational approaches like cross-validation are used for inference

### Learning Activities:

1. **Unsupervised Learning Basics**: Read the provided PDF content and summarize the key points about unsupervised learning.
