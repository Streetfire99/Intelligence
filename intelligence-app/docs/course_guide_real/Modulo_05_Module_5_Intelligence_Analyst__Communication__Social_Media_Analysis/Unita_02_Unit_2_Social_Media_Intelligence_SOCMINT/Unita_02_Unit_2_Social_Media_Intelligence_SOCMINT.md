============================================================

**Objective:**

* Understand the importance of data preprocessing, description, and exploration in data analytics
* Learn how to handle common issues with missing data and data with errors
* Apply statistical methods to improve data quality and validity

**Module Overview:**

This module introduces three key topics: data preprocessing, data description, and data exploration. By the end of this module, you will be able to identify and address common problems with missing data and data with errors.

**Key Concepts:**

### Data Preprocessing

* Definition: The process of preparing raw data for analysis by handling any issues that may affect the quality of the data
* Importance: Ensures that the data is reliable and valid, which is crucial for making informed decisions

### Missing Data

* Definition: Single observations with missing values or incomplete information
* Characteristics:
	+ Can be dependent on a phenomenon inducing the missingness (MAR)
	+ Can be "missing not at random" (MNAR), requiring imputation strategies

### Data With Errors

* Definition: Inconsistent or incorrect data that can lead to flawed analyses
* Considerations:
	+ Errors can impact the reliability and validity of any analysis
	+ Strategies for handling errors include identifying and correcting them, or imputing missing values

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Data Quality**: The quality of the data determines the reliability and validity of any analysis.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle common issues with missing data and data with errors to ensure high-quality data.
3. **Exploration**: Identify patterns and relationships in the data to inform further analysis.
