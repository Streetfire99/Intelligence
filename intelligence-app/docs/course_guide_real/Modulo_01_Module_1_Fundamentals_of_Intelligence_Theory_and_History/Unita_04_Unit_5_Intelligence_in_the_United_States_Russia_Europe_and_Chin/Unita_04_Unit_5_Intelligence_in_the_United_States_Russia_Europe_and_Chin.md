### Activity 1: Comparative Analysis

Read the provided PDF snippet and transcript excerpts. Identify three key differences between the US and one other country's intelligence system (e.g., Russia). Write a brief paragraph summarizing your findings.

**Example Answer**

One notable difference between the US and Russian intelligence systems is the level of transparency. The US has a strong emphasis on intelligence oversight, with congressional committees reviewing intel activities to ensure they stay within legal bounds. In contrast, Russia's intelligence agencies operate under much tighter control, with limited public information available about their activities.
