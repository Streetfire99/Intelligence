**Unit 6: Key Intelligence Concepts - Frameworks, Sources, and Disciplines**
============================================================

### Introduction

In this unit, we will explore the fundamental concepts of intelligence gathering and analysis. We will delve into the intelligence cycle, examining the processes involved in collecting, processing, analyzing, and disseminating information.

### The Intelligence Cycle
--------------------

The intelligence cycle is a structured process that ensures intelligence work is organized rather than haphazard. It consists of five phases:

1. **Direction/Planning**: This phase involves identifying what questions need to be answered or what problems require intelligence support. Leaders or analysts set requirements, ensuring clear priorities are established.
2. **Collection**: In this phase, agencies or analysts gather raw information through various means, such as collecting documents, intercepting communications, conducting interviews, monitoring news and social media, or taking photos via satellites. Collection should follow the requirements set in the direction phase.
3. **Processing/Analysis**: Once information is collected, it needs to be processed (translating foreign documents, decrypting messages, sorting and organizing data). Then comes analysis, where analysts evaluate the information, compare it, and draw conclusions.

### Key Takeaways

* The intelligence cycle is a fundamental framework for understanding how intelligence is produced from start to finish.
* The direction phase sets the stage for the entire process by establishing clear priorities and requirements.
* Collection involves gathering raw information through various means, while processing and analysis involve translating, evaluating, and drawing conclusions from that information.

### Activity

1. Think about a scenario where you need to gather intelligence on a particular topic (e.g., a new product launch). Walk through the intelligence cycle, considering each phase:
	* What questions do you want to answer?
	* How will you collect relevant information?
	* What processing and analysis steps will you take?
2. Discuss with your peers how the intelligence cycle applies to real-world situations.
